[[Nazromir]] is withdrawn back to ![[Serenity atoll#Highpoint Guard|Highpoint Guard]]Serenity Atoll, where he meets with [[Gust]]:
![[SerenityAtoll.jpg]]
The wind subsides to a gentle ocean breeze, and the wooden planks of [[Nazromir]]'s small boat seem to let out a relieved sigh. To some the sudden lack of wind may seem piculiar, but to [[Nazromir]] it was home. Indeed, as if blessed, the island in the middle of the sea never experianced storms or violent waves, as if the inhabitats reflected their mood upon the land. He takes a deep breath, taking in the refreshing ocean smell mixed with sweet flowery scent of the atoll's flora. Looking up, he gazes upon the island. [[Serenity atoll]] was its name, and it certainly fit it. On the lower ranks peaceful fishermen and villagemen tented to thier town, while a mountain path guided monks to the temple of ![[Serenity atoll#Wyrmrest Hall|Wyrmrest hall]]
This was, however, not his destination. Another path led to the templed stronghold of ![[Serenity atoll#Highpoint Guard|Highpoint guard]]

Ascending the long steps up towards the temple, [[Nazromir]] adjusts his traveling pack. It had been a long journey, but [[Gust]]'s call had been clear. He had a mission for them to accomplish, and possibly a revelation to show. "What could it possibly be?", he though, "to require the accompanyment of both a Scale and a Scalebound?". 

Suddenly, time seems to slow. A cold wave of anticipation spreads as it radiated from his right. Quickly, he throws himself in a piruette down the steps and avoids the violent snap of fangs. Sword drawn in the same motion, he steps into a defensive stance and braces the blue tinted gale - as the sea dragon [[Scorn]] swooshes past. "AHAhah!" the dragon cackles, "DON'T LOOSE YOUR FOOTING!". [[Scorn]]'s serpent form slithers through the sky, eventually diving into a cloud and disappearing from view. 

Winded from the exchange, the last steps to Highpoint Guard are made with sword drawn, just in case [[Scorn]] decides to "test his footing" again. Arriving on the courtyard, greeting a few old faces, and some new, Nazromir finds his way to the high tower of [[Gust]]'s quarters. There, by a simple desk and in his human form, a young man with white, hip-length curly hair is pondering over some old piece of lore. He's dressed modestly, in a bright blue patterned robe which seems to always wave in the breeze. ![[GustHuman.jpg]]
[[Gust]] stands up, revealing bandages covering his side. Though they don't seem blodied, so Nazromir determines it was probably some time ago he was injured. 

"Since when did you let yourself get injured", he comments, gesturing to the bandages. "Since when did you get startled by Scorn's 'Lessons'". He motions for Nazromir to approach, and they both embrace. The oppertunity presents itself, and Nazromir sneaks a peak of the scroll splayed across his desk. "[[Accounts of the Orlande tragedy]]", its titled, and seemed to be written in new ink. "Again, I'm so sorry for your wife, Nazromir", Gust says calmly. "Though my asking for you today may not be intirely unrelated", he continues, turning and walking towards a bookshelf. He retrieves a sheet of parchment nestled into the pages of an old book. "I found this prayers book in the cluthes of my fallen assailant, and this within its pages". His voice turning grim, "its a map, and a checklist. It seems the shadow I fought was searching for something. And Nazromir, its extensive. It could be serious. The map suggests the shadow came from the Bloodfields, and intended to move towards Iomedar (The Holy Capital of Loháven). We need to travel there Nazromir. To investigate and be ready if something happens.". Nazromir looks at him with a serious composure, but when he reads the prayer books spine he breaks it. "[[Ghlaunder]]", it reads in shadowtongue, "Disease and Decay".

## Iomedar, capital of the holy Loháven Federation
Traveling by dragonback is an experience like no other, and someone arriving by dragonback is news like no other. Hence, you touch down in the forrested mountains by the city and travel by foot for a day. 

You pass through great gates and under the gaze of great monuments to the gods. You also notice that there seems to be some celebration in town, with colorful decorations hanging above the market streets. You gather the city has visitors, the word is that the tribes of [[The Dale]] seem to be here on some sort of big diplomatic mission. "I hope things aren't as dire as we fear, [[Ghlaunder]] would have a lot of power over a crowd this size", [[Gust]] comments, squeezing his way though a mass of citizens. 

[[Nazromir]] following, notices a stray hand reach into the pocket of a gentlemen loudly arguing with another over the price of a piece of celebration-themed bread. The adolecent thief pockets his prize, and attempts to slink into the crowd. Gust notices Nazromir following with his eyes, and interrupts - "Good thought, but today we choose our battles.".  "We should find out where the diplomatic party will be arriving.", Nazromir responds. Coordinated, they split and search.

![[RedCourtyard.png]]
Later that evening, the duo finds themselves on a vantage point overlooking a marbled courtyard, where the Dale tribes are celebrating with the Loháven lords and ladies. "Heads up", Gust says, gesturing with a nod towards clouds forming in the sky. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the arched palace door towards the courtyard is thrust open with great force. A man in golden armor and white cape stands with gleaming sword in hand, breathing heavily. Through his spyglass, Nazromir is just able to spot tears streaming down his face, mixing with his rustled brown hair. In a swift leap he charges forward, chopping head from shoulders, entrails from body and limb from limb. 

"I'M GOING" - Gust explodes forward of the ledge of the tower and into the air. But he doesn't turn, and time seems to slow for Nazromir. Falling now through the air, Gusts form seem to almost phase in and out of existance, splitting, tearing before hitting the roof tiles below in a bone-echoing crunch, thump and fall through branches and bushes. Nazromir rushes to the ground, where Gust's human body is writhing in pain. 

"Where am I?", Gust says, looking up at Nazromir holding his head high. His eyes seem confused. But its not only that, they seem... different to Nazromir? He doesn't respond, simply looking into Gust's eyes, and as he does, he sees Gust's clear blue eyes' bleed into a radiant yellow. A sudden realisation spreads across Gust's face, and in a moment of clarity he utters a single word "༂༗༓௺༴௷࿇". And to Nazromir it is a wierd experiance. The word carries with it and feeling, like that of dream slipping from the mind in the morning, and the viceral fear of standing at the edge of a waterfall with nothing but the overwhelming roar of the current. And it latches itself into the back of his mind, this wierd feeling, word, power, even though he cant begin to comprehent its immensity.

"WHERE AM I", the radiant-eyed beeing that has taken Gust's place roars. "Wha,... what did you do to me? What... what was that sound?... ANSWER ME!" 

Nazromir lifts his eye-patch, speaking gently, "You're in Iomedar. I do not know what is going on, but its serious and I think we're going to need each other". He then looks over to the massacre with anxious eyes, his thoughts shifting through actions.

The man looks up at him, gaining a semblance of recognition. Nazromir meets his radiant eyes again, and they are both bathed in revalation. Nazromir, that the body of the his mentor is now not Gust's, but inhabited by the soul of the Godking, [[Amaham]]. And the king, apparently that Nazromir is the enemy! Because in the next moment the king thrusts his hand with immense speed towards Nazromir's chest, and the impact sends him flying, reeling in pain - "BEGONE!" the king shouts, "YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED!". Nazromir tumbles through the air, his vision blurred, he feels the impact of water and seemingly skips for a few seconds before splashing to a stop - sinking into the below. Regaining conciousness he reaches for air. Breaking the surface, Nazromir sees the quiet port of [[Serenity atoll]] in the distance. He gathers the-man-once-[[Gust]] must have teleported him, though how is unknown. Teleportation is a very rare skill, and Nazromir known no arcane master with the capability to transport him such a distance.

Once Nazromir regains dry land under his feet, he sprints with all haste to [[Serenity atoll#Highpoint Guard|Highpoint Guard]]. Arriving to the fort, he is greeted by the serpant [[Scorn]]'s roaring in the sky. He spots him, and descends quickly towards him before fiercly transforming into human form. He forcefully puts his hands on Nazromirs shoulders, "WHAT IS GOING ON!?"...."AND WHERE IS YOUR EYEPATCH, SCALEBOUND?". Nazromir hadn't noticed it was gone, he must have dropped it with the blow to his chest. "Scorn, there was a massacre dealt from one of their own, a Loháven Highguard. [[Gust]]..., he intervened. He collapsed out of nowhere, and when I checked on him, he...he was no longer there. [[Amaham]] had somehow gained control over his body, and he thrust me here.". -"WHAT", scorn bursts out, putting a now talon to his chest - "YOU'RE LYING!". He pushes Nazromir back towards the northern steps, "You, you're lying! Gust could not be bested. ITS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE", but then stops. Scorns gaze shifts slightly to the side of Nazromir and over his shoulders - Towards the red, bleeding sky over Loháven. He pushes Nazromir to the side, moving towards the steps. Staring, breathing, huffing for what seems like minutes, he then utters a single word: "Fuck".

Turning his head, he asks Nazromir in a serious tone, "Where you seen?". Nazromir nods. "Then I will deal with this alone. Its not you're fault Nazromir, you were simply not... ready. Take a look in [[Gust]]'s quarters, see if you can find anything. I will go to Loháven, and give my regards.". He takes off, transforming into his serpant form and disappears diving down the cliffside.

In [[Gust]]'s office, Nazromir finds the scroll his mentor was looking into, [[Accounts of the Orlande tragedy]], as well as some small personal items that he leaves in respect. But something is missing... "The prayer book! And [[the shadow's map]]!", he burst out in frustration, remembering how [[Gust]] packed it into their travel bag, and how its probably left up in the tower where they were keeping lookout. Nazromir swears over his misfurtune, but quickly gets out a piece of parchment and some ink to approximatly redraw the map from memory. He draws help from an actual map he finds, which he stashes as well.

He then heads of to the bloodfields, the shadow's last location before it was vanquished, to look for answers.
