The village of Orlande is completely wiped out in disease.
</span>
On the 14th of May 1342, the [[Colonizational Unit for National Tasks of Significance]], led by [[Juliana]], recieved a report of distress and apperent disease in the colonized town of [[Orlande]]. On the 15th of May, a unit of healers and investigators, personally overseen by [[Juliana]] - was dispatched. 

The village folk numbers had dwindled to half of what was before. All were sick under the disease. Though, it did not spread to unit. Within 3 days, all citizens of [[Orlande]] would pass. The bodies were decided by Juliana to be burned, so that their spirits could not haunt them.
