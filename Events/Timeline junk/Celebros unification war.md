The Silver Coast kingdoms unite under one banner
</span>
Long ago, Celebros, the Diarchy of the Silver Coast, fought its founding war in the wake of the desecration. Two lesser nations of elves and of men battled for supremacy, and the right to fertile lands:

**KNOWN TO ONLY ROBERT (RASMUS):**

## The War of the Two Crowns
For centuries, the kingdoms of **Elaria** and **Menaria** had been at war. The elves and the humans both claimed the right to rule over the fertile lands of the valley, where some crops still grew and rivers flowed with clear water. The war had taken a toll on both sides, leaving many dead, wounded, or orphaned.

The kings of both realms were stubborn and proud, refusing to negotiate or compromise. Each believed that his cause was just and that his people deserved to live in peace and prosperity. Each also harbored a deep hatred for the other, fueled by years of bloodshed and betrayal.

One day, the two armies met on the battlefield for what would be the final clash. Elarion, the elven king, led his archers and swordsmen with grace and skill, while Menarion, the human king, commanded his knights and spearmen with strength and courage. The battle was fierce and brutal, with neither side gaining an advantage.

As the sun began to set, the two kings found themselves face to face in the midst of the carnage. They raised their weapons and charged at each other, ready to end the war with their own hands. But as they closed the distance, something unexpected happened.

They saw each other's eyes.

For a brief moment, they felt a connection that transcended their hatred. They saw not an enemy, but a fellow king who loved his people and wanted their protection. They saw not a monster, but an emotional being who suffered and struggled like themselves. They saw not a rival, but a potential ally who shared their vision of a peaceful and prosperous valley.

They lowered their weapons and stopped their horses. They stared at each other in silence, as if they were seeing each other for the first time. They felt a surge of emotion that they could not explain or deny. They felt a spark of attraction that ignited a flame of passion.

They dismounted their horses and walked towards each other. Dropping their helmets and gloves, they embraced. They kissed.

They did not care about the war or the consequences. They did not care about their armies or their subjects. They did not care about anything but each other.

They decided to meet in secret, away from the prying eyes of their followers. A hidden cave in the mountains became their refuge, where they could be alone and express their love. Many hours they spent together, talking, laughing, and making love.

They also talked about the war and how to end it. They realized that they had more in common than they thought, and that they could work together to bring peace and harmony to the valley. They agreed to sign a treaty that would recognize both kingdoms as equal and independent, and that would establish trade and cooperation between them.

They also agreed to announce their love to their people and to marry each other, hoping that their union would symbolize the new era of friendship and understanding between elves and humans.

With joy and hope in their hearts, they returned to their camps. They gathered their councils and prepared to make their declarations.

But fate had other plans.

A spy from Elaria had followed them to their cave and had witnessed their affair. He reported his findings to a group of elven nobles who were loyal to Elarion's cousin, who had always coveted the throne. The nobles saw an opportunity to overthrow Elarion and to continue the war against Menaria.

They plotted a coup d'etat. They poisoned Elarion's wine and stabbed him in his tent. They blamed his death on Menarion's assassins and rallied the elven army for revenge. They attacked the human camp with fury and malice.

Menarion was shocked and devastated by Elarion's death. He did not believe that he was killed by his own people, but he had no proof of his innocence. He tried to reason with the elven nobles, but they ignored his pleas and accused him of treachery. He had no choice but to defend himself and his people.

The battle resumed with renewed violence and hatred. The human army fought bravely, but they were outnumbered and outmatched by the elven army. Menarion was wounded by a sword in his side. He fell from his horse and lay on the ground, bleeding.

He looked up at the sky and saw Elarion's face in his mind. He remembered their love and their dreams. He felt a tear roll down his cheek.

He closed his eyes and died.

But their story did not end there.

### The Triskelion
Among the survivors of the battle, there were some who knew the truth about their kings' love. They were moved by their sacrifice and their vision of peace. They decided to honor their memory by forming a secret society that would help the wounded and the needy, regardless of their race or allegiance.

They called themselves the [[Triskelion]], after the symbol that both kings wore on their cloaks. They adopted the motto: "Empathy, Impartiality, Neutrality". They worked in secret, avoiding detection by the authorities who still waged war on each other.

The [[Triskelion]] also spread the story of their kings' love, hoping that one day it would inspire others to seek reconciliation and harmony. And so, after many years, the people of both nations grew to know the story of love, sacrifice and eventual betrayal by their leaders. They rose up, and overthrew them. The Kingdoms of Elaria and Menaria formed a union, as their Kingâ€™s once did, and to this day the empire of Celebros is ruled as a Diarchy, one Monarch from each realm in holy union.

The [[Triskelion]] moved on, expanding their influence across the world. In turn, they would become a major force. Guided by the belief that their kings' spirits lived on in their hearts, enlightening them and protecting their quest. Today the Triskelion maintains a foothold in most major settlements, and is widely regarded as a force for good and a blessing by the common folk.
