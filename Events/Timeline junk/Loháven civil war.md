With a faltering foundation, war breaks out in Iomedae's absence. 
</span>
70 years after [[Iomedae]] left [[Loháven]] after [[Loháven is united]], the people looked to other gods as guidence. A great rift in sentiment drove the conflict, some wanted to return to the old ways small local farming communities, citing the great crack as a failiure of great civilizations. Many of these followed [[Erastil]], who encouraged  good deeds without the flowery retoric. Others looked to the god of cities, law and merchants - [[Abadar]], and wanted to build Loháven into a great prospering empire. 

The conflict lasted 40 years, but wasn't particurarly bloody. Small skirmishes here and there were definately present, but mostly people participated in debates or honorable one-on-one duels - perhaps guided by [[Iomedae]]'s tenents. 

In the end, People agreed their ideals weren't necessarily opposed, and the holy Federation was formed. Allowing individual smaller communities to prosper under the protection of the larger whole, while preserving their autonomy in most issues.
