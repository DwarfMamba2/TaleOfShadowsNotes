Ancient heros stop a cataclysmic threat. The world is forged anew. 
</span>
The Reformation/The Crack/The Cataclysm/The Reforging tossed the world into the forge of the gods to be born anew by a greater image. The Material, Fey, [Redacted] planes were merged into something new, sometimes called The Prime Plane. 

The cultures and civilizations of the Old World were mostly reset, as the Gods reformed the lands to their own pleasure. This period of terraformation is why the whole event is called "The Reformaiton" by some.
