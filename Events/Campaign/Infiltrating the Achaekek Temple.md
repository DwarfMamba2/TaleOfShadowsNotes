The party dives into the murderous depths which the Vipers call home.

[[Scorn]] shows off his physical might by crushing the heads of two sleeping mantises, [[Kraxia]] looks on, horrified.

Kraxia warns about the upcoming [[Achaekek Temple#The Whispering Hall|Wispering Hall]], and heeds the party not to listen to its whispers.

[[Lucian]] listens to the enchanting whispers of the hall:
>Hon är förbannad... Údun förhäxa hennes kropp... Hon är förbannad... Údun förhäxa hennes kropp... Han är förbannad... Údun mörka hans själ... Hon är välsignad... Anor belyser hennes själ...

The party arrives in a large room housing a enormous statue of a mantis. The wall behind the statue bears runic marks. Around the sides of the room are corridors where priests in simple clergical robes walk.

[[Robert Sköld|Robert]] shows of his roguish talents by pickpocketing a key from a male human priest at the behest of [[Kraxia]]. The key allegedly leads to the part of the temple which belongs to [[The Vipers]]. 

The key leads to a [[Achaekek Temple#Sacrificial Offering Room|sacrificial offering room]] where a dwarf is cut open and layed on display. He wears green stones in his beard which [[Bob the Balchemist|Bob]] recalls identifies him as a [[Goldneck]], from [[Baal]].

The party is then lead to a meditation-room. The room is circular and sound-isolated by heavy drapes. Smaller chambers surround the main room. Kraxia attempts to run ahead to covertly enter the code but Nazromir keeps up with him, noting that the code is Moon-Mantis-Sword-Skull-Heart. Kraxia shares that there is a giant spirit who lends the strength of [[Achaekek]] to [[Vissariss]].  The party decides that Kraxia has served his purpose and execute him. Nazromir applies the poison Kraxis was carrying to his brightfang. 

The party, with the help of [[Scorn]], slay the spirit and navigate their way through further puzzles.
