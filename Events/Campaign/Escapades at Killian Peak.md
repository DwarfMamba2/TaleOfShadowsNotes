On the 24th, the party sets off to find Killian Peak. The party locates a manor which they believe to be Killian Peak. Robert breaks in and discovers that the house belongs to a Neville Bertsson and that the maid is named Fiona. The party returns fruitless in their finding only to discover that they broke in to the wrong mansion. The actual mansion is 1.5 days west of town. 

On their way to the actual Killian Peak, they meet a party of knights escorting a wagon. Inside the wagon is Alexander, with short blonde hair. 

The party finally locates the actual mansion, ontop a round sheer plateau. They get ontop of the roof and Nazromir manages to get inside a office. The office clearly used to contain a "sending-desk". Nazromir finds some books:

* "[[The Case for a New Dawn]]" by [[Indra Hyllinger]]. The book is 200 years old.  
* "Rise Up - In the aftermath of [[The Desecration]]" by G.D. 
* One of the notes left on the floor is the following:

Indicating that what happened in [[Iomedar]] was connected to the Starchilds. Regardless the party realises that they must make their way to [[Blighthollow]]. 

Upon attempting to sneak away from the manor, [[Lucian]] accidentally makes a sound by stepping on loose gravel on the path leading up to the entrance. Four of the stone statues animate and attack the party. [[Nazromir]] uses his newly purchased scroll of conjure elemental to summon a earthen mephit which enlarges itself and flies away with [[Robert Sköld]] and Nazromir. Through a combination of clever arcane tricks and tactics, the party is able to dispatch of the statues. The party spots the gardener and caretaker of the estate but Nazromir is able to both persuade him of his safety and deceive him that the party are associates of [[Alexander Starchild]] who have returned to grab a few forgotten items.

The party searches the estate, finding many interesting belongings of Alexander. Nazromir grabs a set of his extravagant clothes. From Alexander's chambers, they also grab a locked and intricate box. Upon investigating the dining hall, they locate hidden staircase behind the portrait of holy knight/paladin. After surviving a deadly trap on their way down the stairs, the party discovers a cult meeting room with a sacrificial altar. The party grabs a set of masks and white robes with golden details. They also grab a sacrificial dagger, a bracelet made of raven feathers and a blue precious stone. Nazromir contemplates on the nature of the room and ritual sacrifices: Mainly evil deities demand sentient sacrifices. There are of course exceptions such as if a good god wants to interrogate the soul of a evil-doer. Some deities return power as a reward for sacrifices. [[Pharasma]] is a god with some raven iconography, reminiscent of the rooms décor.

In the guard quarter, the party finds a wanted poser of [[Rayleigh (Jirarn)]], wanted for murder.  

The party departs the estate, with an ominous feeling that the intrigues at play may be deeper than they first suspected.
