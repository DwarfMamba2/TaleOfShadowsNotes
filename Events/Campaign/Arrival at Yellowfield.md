Nazromir's search takes him to Yellowfield.
</span>

After searching [[Bloodfield|The Bloodfields]] for clues for a month, [[Nazromir]] hears rumor about a hobgoblin clad in the mane of a dragon. It turns out to be [[Bom]], a close ally of [[Rayleigh (Jirarn)]]. [[Bom]] got ahold of the mane, which turned out to belong to [[Gust]], from a half-orc with a broken leg whomst had been exiled from his tribe. 

[[Nazromir]] followed the strange pair and eventually met up with [[Robert Sköld]] and [[Bob the Balchemist]]. [[Rayleigh (Jirarn)]] was arrested for the murder of a member of the [[Blue Fang Gang]].

[[Nazromir]] and [[Robert Sköld]] joined forces and were invited to [[Mayor Edwin]]'s estate on behalf of their mysterious patron [[Rose]].
