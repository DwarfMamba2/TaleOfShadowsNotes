### Journey to Farshore Port
[[Nazromir]], [[Robert Sköld]], [[Bob the Balchemist]] and [[Rose]] commandeer a small ship whose owner was slaughered during the raid on [[Yellowfield]] and make their way to [[Farshore Port]]. Nazromir shares some of his past as a [[The Brightfangs|Brightfang]]. Robert in turn shares that he was inducted into [[Triskelion]] after he was saved by them as a child and that he just recently completed his training. Rose shares some of his past and his involvement with [[The Twillight Veil]]. 

### Arrival
The party arrives in the bustling harbor of [[Farshore Port]]. It is apparent from the wealth that the city siphons resources from the regions colonies and profits from the sale of them. [[Rose]] suggests that the party should take up lodging at the [[Seafarer's Rest]]. 

On first noticing that the [[Farshore Port#Union Church|Union Church]] does not cast a shadow, Nazromir overhears a whisper coming from Robert: "Their attempts to hide the shadow will only upset the balance and cause the shadow to appear elsewhere where it will inflict harm in other ways"

### Investigating the secret room
After being shown the abode of [[Rose]] the party makes their way to [[Seafarer's Rest]] where they come across [[Lennart]]. Lennart is a bald intoxicated cleric who is standing outside the tavern pissing on his holy symbol of [[Anor]]. It is revealed that he was part of [[The New Dawn]] before their transgression grew too much for him. Upon finding common interests, he leads the party to a secret hideout of [[The New Dawn]], a small scribe's room accessible from an alley not far from [[Farshore Port#Union Church|The Union Church]]. The room is filled with miscellaneous church-related documents. Below a secret trapdoor in the floor are crates full of church records and records of the construction of the city and who built what. The last year of record is 1327, 17 year ago. Many of the documents use "Ljusbryggan, Farshore Port" as an address. 

In the middle of their investigation and trashing, the party are barged in upon by three members of [[The New Dawn]]. A fight ensues where Lennart and two of the attackers lose their lives. One of the clerics manages to escape. A mysterious figure who had been watching the encounter, [[Lucian]], steps out from the shadows and offers to take the party to his safehouse.

Lucian reveals that he is a member of [[The Twillight Veil]], an organisation who aims to stop [[The New Dawn]]. The Twillight Veil aims to preserve balance, they resent the aim to have the world be only light. They where formed by people touched by [[Udún]]'s influence but grew to be more radical. Right now Lucian is investigating the connection between The New Dawn and [[Colonizational Unit for National Tasks of Significance]].  He knows that [[Alexander Starchild|Alexander]] and [[Botés Starchild]] are currently in Farshore Port. They are two highly ranked members of C.U.N.T.S and The New Dawn. Lucian knows the location of their estate.

Upon examining the plans for the city, Nazromir notices what he belives to be a secret room below the main floor of [[Farshore Port#Church of Sarenrea|Church of Sarenrae]], along with the fact that many prison cells and a torture room are located below [[Farshore Port#The Vigilant Watchtower|The Vigilant Watchtower]]. 

### Exploring the town
The party heads out to the town to look for work. Upon examining the local notice board, they find multiple interesting assignments:
* Stolen Shipment - By [[Janne Järntand]]. A shipment has been stolen by goblins outside of town, please recover it. 60gp reward. 
* Abandoned Mine - By [[Janne Järntand]]. A mine which holds "sun-ore" has been overrun by skeletons, clear them out. 70 gp reward. 
* Pest Problems - The [[Dragon's Den]] tavern has a problem with a sudden influx of bugs, exterminate the infestation. 20 gp reward.
* Harpy Bounty - As always, the town guard pays 10 gp per delivered head of a harpy.
* Announcement from Iomedar - The town awaits a procession from the capital, be there to behold it. 

Nazromir makes his way to [[Farshore Port#Church of Sarenrea|Church of Sarenrae]] to seek answers about the ring he cut from [[Rayleigh (Jirarn)]]. He enlists the help of the priest [[Ghunbert]] to identify it. It turns out that the ring is connected to the ethereal realm, realities in the ethereal manifest themselves as whispers through the ring. A whispering bind. The ring also possesses a mind and will of its own and it carries a curse connected to [[Udún]]. The wearer of the ring shuns social relationship and steers one away from trusting others. Due to the intrinsic nature of the ring's curse and effect, having the curse removed would be nearly impossible. 

### Call to aid the Crusade
Ett krigsskepp anländer i Red Water Bay, och till Farshore Port. Ekor slussar material och folk från skeppet. Lådor tas till vigilant watchtower och till torget. Soldaterna sätter upp verksamhet i en lagerlokal nära hamnen. En man/Prästgeneral, [[Farshore Port#Fernando Weaver|Fernando Weaver]], ställer sig på en scen på torget. Mannen har blodröda robes, är flintskallig, och bär Iomedae's symbol av ett svärd runt halsen och på ryggen. 
- "Mina medborgare. Gudalandet har inte glömt er. Ert jobb här ute på civilizationens rand är anmärkningsvärt! - Mitt namn är [[Farshore Port#Fernando Weaver|Fernando Weaver]], och jag kommer på heligt uppdrag från huvudstaden. Er Påve, [[Amaham]], har överlevt ett mordförsök! Han reste sig igen, starkare än någonsin som Gudkung [[Amaham]]! Prisa vare han, [[Anor]]'s ljus välsigna han, [[Abadar]]'s kraft stärk honom, och [[Iomedae]]'s rättvisa led honom! - [[Amaham]] söker rättvisa för denna brutalitet! Ledd av highguard [[Ylladin]]! Och sjätte präst, blivit förste präst - [[Bernhardt]]! Ert land behöver er mer än någonsin! Om ni misstänker konspiration mot federationen, eller har viktig information om förrädare från [[The Dale|Dalen]], tveka inte att rapportera det! Ni kommer bli rättvist kompenserade!" - För att visa er Gudkungs uppskattning kommer en festival att anordnas imorgon! Sprid ordet! Hedra er Gudkung [[Amaham]]! Prise vare han! Amen! 

**What do the people think of this?** Vissa tycker det är rätt, andra bryr sig inte mycket om den där [[Amaham]]. Nån säger att de hört att [[Amaham]] tog kroppen av sin länge försvunna son. Andra berättar om hur de hört om [[Ylladin]], som nu kallas Painter, och hur han mördade alla djävularna som var där och invaderade från [[The Dale]].

Ylladin Painter, var guyen som slaktade på the red day. The dale är ett område som historiskt motstått sig kolonoliseringen. 

### Djupa Hålet
After watching the announcement, the party visits [[Janne Järntand]] to take up his quest of clearing out the mine [[Djupa Hålet]]. It turns out that he has taken on a commission which requires a lot of sun ore and he has misquoted the price. The party travels to the mine and clears it out, nearly losing Nazromir to the final monster, a horrible amalgamation of bones and darkness. They make their way back to Janne and happily accept a +1 Full Plate as a reward. 

### Festival
The party takes part of the festivites, proving themselves moderately adept at many of the games. They are invited to a gathering for prayer, called [[Luminous Devotion]], at the [[Farshore Port#Union Church|Union Church]].
