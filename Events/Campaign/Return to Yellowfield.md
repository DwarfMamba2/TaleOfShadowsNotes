Meditating on the previous day, Nazromir contemplates the [[Mysterious Divine Language]] he heard as he lost conciousness. He realises that the sound shares some rare aspects with both celestial and abyssal (Critical success). He also contemplates the nature of the power, falling asleep grasping both his symbol of [[Irori]] and [[Sarenrae]], when a awakes, the symbol of [[Sarenrae]] is hot to the touch. 

After just shy of a day's journey, [[The Rivercock]] returns to yellowfield. The party reunites with [[Rose]] in [[Mayor Edwin]]'s estate. The party shares the information they have gathered with him, along with the seemingly encrypted [[Mayor Edwin's Journal|journal]]. They learn that [[Rose]] once had a much higher noble office but gave it up, partially voluntarily, and now focuses on doing what he can to make a difference. He shares information about [[The New Dawn]], they wear symbols of a sun, similar to the symbol of [[Anor]] and have a high quarter in [[Farshore Port]]. [[Bob the Balchemist]] shares information with [[Lady Isadora]] and is tasked to spy on the party. 

The party decides to join [[Rose]], or as he preferes to be called, [[The Patron]], in traveling to [[Farshore Port]] the next day. However, the next morning the [[Blue Fang Gang]] decide to take control over the town in the percieved power vacuum. They, along with all the towns remaining guards are however slaughered in a sudden massacre by [[Crimson Claws|The Crimson Claws]]. [[Rayleigh (Jirarn)]] challenges [[Slice]] in single combat but is defeated. [[Slice]] is shot down shortly after. Losing control over the tribe, they ransack the entire village, killing civilians who resist. The party are ambushed by a few member of the tribe but manage to defeat them. After the raid has completed, the party finds an unconcious but still breathing [[Rayleigh (Jirarn)]] in the street. Nazromir finds that the mysterious ring which he received visions of is adhered to Rayleigh's finger and so he decides to take the whole finger, making sure that the wound is bandaged and not mortal. The party decides to leave Rayleigh to his fate and set of to [[Farshore Port]] with [[Rose]].
