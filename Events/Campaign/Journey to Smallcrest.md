As part of Mayor Edwin's entourage, the party sets of for Smallcrest
</span>
Traveling on [[The Rivercock]], the party sets of for Smallcrest on a unknown mission. [[Mayor Edwin]] is joined by his entourage of 5 guards, 3 servants (including [[Bob the Balchemist]]), 3 healers and 1 navigator. The healers are devout followers of [[Sarenrae]] and are carrying gear for disease and plague-control. The guards carry bows and spears, weapons typical for long range combat. Nazromir suspects that they will be fighting some sort of disease outbreak or even undead. After 1.5 days, they arrive in [[Smallcrest]].
