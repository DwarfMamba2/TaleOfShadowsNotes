#Region
The name comes from the words Carvable Green in dwarvish. Some may think this comes from the plentiful forests covering the island, however, those would not know the dwarves. The dwarves live in the below, and the rock here is saturated with Serpentine and Epidote and bejeweled by Chrome diopside (emerald like) and Mithral.

Dur’Gurn holds a couple of dwarven kingdoms. These include “[[Behl’Gurn]]/Behlur” (below green) with its radiant crystal roof halls, “Ba’al’gurn”/”[[Baal]]” (above green) with its fortresses on the surface shores, and [[Titan’s End]] carved into the hull of an ancient dragon turtle. Off the shores of [[Baal]], the currents of the ocean create a giant gold wash type neck, which is how [[Baal]] got its wealth. This resource is kept by the dwarves, despite the neck’s geographical proximity to the fey realms of [[Galia]].
