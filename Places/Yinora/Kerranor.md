*"Longing for Anor"*
Kerranor is a city, civilization, under the branches of the lighttree [[Salohlir]] "Gift of Light".
Creatures of all kinds walk the street, but they are generally good-hearted. That is if you don't live outside the walls. There the light of Salohlir is dim, and the hearts of the people tainted by the encroaching darkness.
