**“Celebros”, or “Silver coast”**, a name derived from Tolkien’s elvish words for “silver” and “foam”, a Diarchy that is located near the sea and enjoys its bounty in the twilight hours. [[Ashenfell]]’s volcano’s smoke causes the sunset to be reflected blue, along with the cold causing ice crystals to form in the air. 

  
The Celebros Diarchy is as hinted by its name traditionally ruled by Two, currently Two women [[Aspera Di & Clara Di]], a human and an elf. They are a quiet nation, though Aspera dreams of expanding their borders to the south. The nation as a whole has some interest in Ashenfell as its plume has cultural significance. Its citizens are often met with chain, though outsiders are treated with respect.
