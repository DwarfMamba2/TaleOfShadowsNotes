#Region 
**The Northern Empire of light “Loháven”/“Loralondë”** believes they are chosen by the gods to uphold goodness and freedom in the world. They possess certain “gifted” (stolen, colonized) holy relics that solidify their conviction. To their own citizens though, the Northern Empire of Loháven treats them with utmost care. Starvation is a thing of the past, these holy relics and the holy court of magic grants upon its citizens wonders. Everyone deserves their part as long as they do their part.
