## NPC
### Mayor Edwin #NPC
[[MayorEdwin.jpeg|portrait]]
Mayor Edwin von Jules is a large round human with a clean shaved head and face. He is in close connection with the [[Yellowfield#City Guard|city guard]], (especially [[Yellowfield#Tristan of the City Guard NPC|Tristan]]) and likes to wave them around as a big stick to get what he wants. He doesn't care much for the infractions of the two local gangs, [[Crimson Claws]] and [[Blue Fang Gang]]. In fact, its rumoured that the [[Blue Fang Gang]] is cooperating with the mayor, as disagreements with the mayor often results in a raid by the Lizard gang. 

Mayor Edwin is soon holding a party, an event that he is sure will skyrocket his status among the nobility. This is because a recent expedition into the fields has brought back a magical item, and the ruins promise more! In this way, he intends to attract people and resourses from the [[Loháven|Loháven Empire]].
