**The “Maw”**, a volcanic mountain so high few manage the climb for a simple lack of oxygen. The Maw spews dust particles of zeolite, hematite, olivine, and magnetite into the stratosphere which colors the sky a silvery blue. Oftentimes, the plume obscures the sun and creates an eternal veil of smoky clouds dropping ashfalls.
