**Crime syndicate island “Ashenfell”**, The island of Ashenfell is where dreams come to die, unless you’re a crime lord of course. Its the place with the greatest diversity of races and cultures, most of which resides in the largest city on the island which shares its name. The Island is home to multiple small volcanoes, but triumphed by the “Maw”, a mountain so high few manage the climb for a simple lack of oxygen. The Maw spews dust particles of zeolite, hematite, olivine, and magnetite into the stratosphere which colors the sky a silvery blue. Oftentimes, the plume obscures the sun and creates an eternal veil of smoky clouds dropping ashfalls. The island is surrounded by multiple small volcanic islands, one of which houses the city of Blighthollow.
