**Flying islands “Mid-sea islands”/“Kailani”** (Hawaiian for sea and sky) - The Mid-sea islands, also known as Kailani by the natives, are a cluster of floating landmasses that hover over the inland sea. The islands vary in size and shape, but most of them have lush vegetation and abundant wildlife.
