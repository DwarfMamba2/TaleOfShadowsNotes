An island of peace living enlightened monks is also the home of [[The Scales]].

## The Scales
On this island and others in the surrounding reef, most of the 20 Scales make their personal homes. 10 or so stay permanently in the main temple, [[Serenity atoll#Wyrmrest Hall|Wyrmrest hall]]. In 1180, [[Gust]] and [[Scorn]] form construct another temple, [[Serenity atoll#Highpoint Guard|Highpoint guard]], to serve the Fangs interests.

With its beautiful landscape, the hills and canyons surrounding Wyrmrest hall is certainly conducive to achieving a higher state of enlightenment. Wyrmrest hall itself houses 10 or so permament Scales, and around 200 Scalebound. 
### Highpoint Guard

The quarters of highpoint guard are oftentimes these days filled with trainees. 160 years after its initial founding, The Fangs have now expanded to ~50 fully trained Scalebound, with ~70 more in training.
