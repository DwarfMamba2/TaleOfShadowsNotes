**Eastern Authoritarian Empire “Aranor”**, a name derived from Tolkien’s elvish words for “king” and “land”. Elven King with a waring demeanor. The nation often plunders those lost on the seas, and stages raiding parties Galia and the dwarven kingdoms. The elves in this nation have a different relationship with their past lives. They believe they are in an eternal cycle of war and rest, where they plunder and gather resources in this world (Naryaure, which means "fiery wealth") to then pass onto the next where they rest, in “Lómenosta”-haven of twilight.
