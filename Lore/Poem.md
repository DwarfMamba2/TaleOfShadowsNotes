**Verily**, in the beginning did the gods strive for balance,
Yet in their squabbling did they disturb the equilibrium's elegance.
Thus, they struck a deal, a pact most solemn and sure,
To divide light and darkness, yea, even to the furthest shore.

**Thus**, the gods of light ever bathe one side in their luminous rays,
Whilst the gods of night cloak the other in an endless dark haze.
Yet, each side hath a window into the other's realm,
A tree of light and a moon, that doth serve as a balanced helm.
