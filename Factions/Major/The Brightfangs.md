Gust and Scorn construct Highpoint Guard and found the Fangs 
</span>
### Founding
In 1180, Gust and Scorn construct [[Serenity atoll#Highpoint Guard|Highpoint Guard]] with the help of 5 original Scalebound. Once their templed fort is completed, [[Ci’taon]], a wizard from [[Nólalóte]], performs his first experiments to enhance the physical ability of their alligienced Scalebound. Of the original 5, only one survive - [[Talon]]. Thenceforth, it is decided that the procedure it too dangerous to perform on adults, and the next generation of Fangs are all brought up from birth with iterative enhancements as they age.

### Operation
Today 20 Scalebound are scattered across the land. They act mostly on their own initiative to preserve peace and balance across the lands. Oftentimes you may find them freeing a lonesome town from the tyranny of a wild monster, guiding a mad prisoner to the path of enlightenment, or research occult lore in far off lands. Sometimes though, organised parties venture into the darkness of the lands beyond the terminator - Yinora, to set a stop to spreading evil.
