# The Scales & Scalebound
The Scales/Scalebound is an organization constituted of followers of [[Irori]], the god of self enlightenment and perfection. It is originally a cooperation between Good-aligned dragons (who long ago befriended Irori before his ascension), and people they believe are blessed by [[Irori]]. They stand for self enlightenment, sharing of that knowledge and balance among all things. The organization was originally ruled by dragons “Scales”, but in the recent century humanoids “Scalebound” have been allowed into the authority-circle. Scales, however, still hold the lone right to recruit new members. The organization has ~20 Scales, and 200 scalebound. They mainly reside on the island of [[Serenity atoll]] and but have holdings in [List]. #Todo 

## The Brightfangs
[[Nazromir is born|Nazromir]] is was picked up as a baby by the shapechanged sky dragon “[[Gust]]”, who had seen signs in the sky of a blessing. [[Gust]] was indeed an esteemed member of The Scales (draconid), and had the power to introduce new recruits to The Scalebound (humanoid). Unlike other sky dragons though, [[Gust]] had ambitions that stretched beyond lawful tradition. It was under his and the Sea Dragon “[[Scorn]]”’s push that a new wing of the organization was born, [[The Brightfangs]], who would for the first time put their teachings of inner perfection to (potentially) bloody practice. They would venture out into the world, flush out evil and imbalance, and promote enlightened self improvement. 

Under this initiative, the organization's previous methods of intellectual and spiritual enlightenment were expanded with bodily enhancement. [[Gust]] and [[Scorn]] recruited children with particular affinity or malleability to magic, and augmented them at a young age. This was facilitated by [[Scorn]]’s questionable alliance with a wizard of the Wizard island of “[[Nólalóte]]” - Island of the wise. [[Ci’taon]] (“Ci-Town”) was his name, and shared [[Gust]] and especially [[Scorn]]’s disdain for possessing the knowledge to do good but not putting it to use. Their initiative started in 1180, making [[Nazromir]] one of the earliest additions to the corp. Today (1345, 165 years after [[The Brightfangs]] founding) there are ~50 fully trained Scalebound, and ~70 more in training.
